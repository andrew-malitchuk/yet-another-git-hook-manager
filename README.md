__YAGHM__ - Yet Another Git Hook Manager - is a cutting-edge Gradle plugin designed to streamline
the management of Git hooks within your project. Utilizing the power of Gradle Kotlin DSL (KTS),
YAGHM enables you to define and store your Git hook configurations directly within your build
scripts, offering a seamless and integrated approach to project configuration. Additionally, YAGHM
supports the option to copy and use configurations from existing files, providing flexibility for
teams with established setups.

## Features

- Install Git Hooks from Gradle DSL.
- Install Git Hooks from Configuration Files.
- Review Git Hook Status.
- Flexible Configuration Options.

## Installation

Apply the plugin in your project module and configure plugin via DSL:

<details open><summary>Kotlin</summary>

```kt
plugins {
    id("io.github.andrew-malitchuk.yaghm") version "0.0.1-a.1"
}
```

</details>

<details><summary>Groovy</summary>

## Usage

YAGHM provides an intuitive and streamlined approach to managing Git hooks within your Gradle
projects. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to get you started with YAGHM:

### Install Git Hook

`installGitHook` - scans your Gradle configuration for defined hooks and installs them into the
`.git/hooks` directory of your repository.

Examples:

```shell
./gradlew installGitHook
```

### Remove Git Hook

`removeGitHook` - allows you to remove Git hooks.

Examples:

```shell
./gradlew removeGitHook
```

### Review Git Hook

`reviewGitHook` - generates a detailed list of all the Git hooks installed in your repository.

Examples:

```shell
./gradlew reviewGitHook 
```

## Configuration

```shell
yaghm {
    gitHook {
        configure("pre-commit") {
            onFile {
                "foobar.txt"
            }
        }
        preCommit {
            doFirst {
                echo("hello world")
            }
            action {
                "echo \"main action\""
            }
            doLast {
                gradle("detekt")
            }
            useShebang {
                Interpreter.BASH
            }
        }
    }
}
